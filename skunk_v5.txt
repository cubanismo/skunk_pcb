-Use Cypress EZHost GPIO25 and GPIO28 to drive EEPROM chip select line.
 -Need to AND with CS from Jaguar, so add a tiny 2xAND IC as well.
 -Used XSON8 package 2 channel/2 input AND gate IC, largely because it was all
  that would fit in the remaining available area.  Going to be a pain to
  solder though!

-Needed to reproduce some Rev. 4 modifications:
 -Extend GND/VCC planes over to right edge of board including even more area
  than Rev. 4, but with some room carved out for the vias to the inner
  layers.
 -Raise GND/VCC planes up away from bottom of larger portion of edge
  connector to make room for the four Serial EEPROM control signal traces,
  which will route through the inner two layers that are usually reserved for
  GND/VCC.
 -Routed J0.B40, J0.B42, and J0.B43 through inner layer 1, and J0.A43 through
  inner layer 2 over to right side of board for Serial EEPROM chip select,
  clock, and data in+out lines.
 -Enlarged Mini USB mounting pads to make them more secure
 -Moved version info silkscreen over to left edge of board, updated to
  Rev. 5, thanked Tursi.

-Additional layout modifications:
  -Flipped C1 horizontally to make room for vias to route GPIO lines on back
   of board to get around C1 and JTAG traces
  -Rerouted nearby JTAG traces to make space for vias near
   GPIO25 and GPIO28
  -Move X1 down to make more space for GPIO traces to pass through near
   cartridge mount hole under USB 2/J3
  -Rerouted one of the XTAL/clock traces under U1/EZHost to free up space for
   vias back to the front of the board under the J2/USB 2 connector
   * Risky, moves clock very close to R1 trace, and JTAG trace a little
     closer to sensitive USB D+/D- vias.
  -Added U5, and U6, pads for 93C46/93C66/93C86 Serial EEPROM save-game
   chips. Unlike Rev. 4, connect pins 6 and 7 to VCC to ensure 16-bit
   organization is selected and write-protection is disabled if using the
   variants of these chips that support such features. on other variants,
   these pins are not connected, so there will be no change in behavior.
  -Added U7, pads for a tiny XSON8 dual AND gate IC which will assist the
   GPIO lines in selecting between the two Serial EEPROM save-game chips.

-Don't put traces too close to USB traces: See notes in
 pcb3/pcb/usbhub-layout.pdf for details.  These traces prefer privacy.

-See butcher/butcher.txt for details on the weird GPIO routing on EZHost and
 how it allows proper booting.

-TODO:
 -Silkscreen:
  -Bottom
   -Difficult, in that it isn't done in FreePCB, since it does not support
    importing/drawing real graphics. The previous manufacturing releases
    appear to have used an autocad file converted directly to gerber format.
   -Want to add a few things to the existing one, so I can't directly re-use
    the Rev. 3 files:
    -Add a "CE (collectors edition)" to the logo somewhere.
    -Add the JTAG pin labels from Rev. 4 (were very helpful)
    -Potentially label Jaguar connector pin numbers like on front of Rev. 4.
    -Add public-domain 2020 copyright line
 -Triple-check Serial EEPROM pin->Jaguar pin mapping
 -Triple-check EZHost GPIO routing.

-Soldermask minimum web (clearance between pads to allow mask between them):
 -The minimum pad spacing on the board is 0.2mm (~7.874mil). If the minimum
  web is less than that, we can't get any mask between the smaller pads,
  which would make hand-soldering more difficult.
  -Osh Park claims minimum soldermask web is 0.102mm (4mil)
  -PCBWay claims minimum soldermask web (bridge) for advanced PCBs is 0.102mm
   (4mil) for "black" soldermask, which I'm assuming means all non-green.
  -JLCPCB claims minimum soldermask web is 0.254mm (10mil) for non-green
   masks, 0.2mm for green. This seems high, but they also appear to include
   expansion in their web/bridge min, whereas other places don't. If you
   calculate it out, an expansion of 3mil * 2 + 4mil minimum web, you get
   10mil, or 0.254mm, so that must be what they're capable of in practice,
   even though they claim 0.05mm/2mil expansion.
  
-Soldermask expansion ("Swell pads for soldermask" in FreePCB CAM dialog):
 -The project had this set to 7.874mil (~0.2mm), which seems huge. Perhaps
  this was just to avoid attempting tiny bridges between the 0.2mm-spaced
  pads. Assuming that was the case, I set it to 6mils for now, which still
  easily wipes out the mask around the QFN/MSOP/TSOP/XSON8 parts, and just
  covers the 0.3mm space between the USB mini connector pads as well.
 -allpcb claims the industry standard is ~4mil (~0.102mm) to account for
  growth, retraction and shift.
 -Osh Park claims a maximum of 3mil (0.077mm)
 -PCBWay doesn't list a number here, but a blog from 2014 says, for SMD pads,
  0.05mm (~2mil) is good, 0.075mm (~3mil) is better. The same blog claims a
  minimum web of 0.15mm (~6mil): 0.05 * 2 + 0.15mm = 0.25mm pad spacing.
 -JLCPCB claims 0.05mm (~2mil) is acceptable, but see above. 3mil is probably
  more realistic.

-Soldermask conclusions:
 -What this comes down to is we can't quite get soldermask between the 0.2mm-
  spaced pads and stay within specs for non-green boards. Hrmph. The smart
  thing to do would probably be to just order green boards.  Oshpark only
  supports the purple ones though, so I guess we can just get some prototypes
  made without solder bridge between the fine-pitch parts and see how it
  goes soldering them. I can't tell for sure whether the Rev. 4 boards had
  mask betwen the pins as I've burnt mine up pretty bad.
