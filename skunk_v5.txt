-Use GPIO25 and GPIO28 to drive EEPROM chip select line.
 -Need to AND with CS from Jaguar, so add a tiny 2xAND IC as well.
 -Used XSON8 package 2 channel/2 input AND gate IC, largely because it was all
  that would fit in the remaining available area.  Going to be a pain to
  solder though!

-Need to reproduce Rev. 4 modifications almost entirely
 -Only difference is move U5 down, maybe move vias it uses to make space for
  U6 and U7
 -Extend GND/VCC planes over to right edge of board.
 -Raise GND/VCC planes up away from bottom of larger portion of edge
  connector to make room for the four Serial EEPROM control signal traces,
  which will route through the inner two layers that are usually reserved for
  GND/VCC.
 -<XXX detail which pins are routed where here>
 -Move version info silkscreen over to left edge of board, thank Tursi.
-Don't put traces too close to USB traces: See notes in
 pcb3/pcb/usbhub-layout.pdf for details.  These traces prefer privacy.

-See butcher/butcher.txt for details on the weird GPIO routing on EZHost and
 how it allows proper booting.

-Layout modification tasks:

  -Flip C1 horizontally

  -Reroute nearby JTAG traces to make space for vias near
   GPIO25 and GPIO28

  -Reroute one of the XTAL/clock traces under the PCB to free up space for
   vias back to the front of the board under the USB 2 connector
   * Risky, moves clock very close to R1 trace, and JTAG trace a little
     closer to sensitive USB D+/D- vias.

  -Move X1 down to make more space for GPIO traces to pass through near
   cartridge mount hole under USB 2/J3

-TODO:
 -Silkscreen:
  -Add bottom silk layer with the skunk logo and JTAG labels
  -Move version info to left side of board
  -Update copyright year to 2020, indicate public domain
  -Add a thank you to Tursi
 -Enlarge Mini USB mounting pads to make them more secure

-Prototype on Rev. 4 PCB:
 -Green  = GPIO25, Cypress
 -Yellow = GPIO28, Cypress
 -White  = SF_CS, Jaguar
 -Blue   = CS, 93C46
