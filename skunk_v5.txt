-Use GPIO25 and GPIO28 to drive EEPROM chip select line.
 -Need to AND with CS from Jaguar, so add a tiny 2xAND IC as well.
 -Used XSON8 package 2 channel/2 input AND gate IC, largely because it was all
  that would fit in the remaining available area.  Going to be a pain to
  solder though!

-Needed to reproduce some Rev. 4 modifications:
 -Extend GND/VCC planes over to right edge of board, but carved out some room
  for extra vias to inner layers
 -Raise GND/VCC planes up away from bottom of larger portion of edge
  connector to make room for the four Serial EEPROM control signal traces,
  which will route through the inner two layers that are usually reserved for
  GND/VCC.
 -Routed J0.B40, J0.B42, and J0.B43 through inner layer 1, and J0.A43 through
  inner layer 2 over to right side of board for Serial EEPROM chip select,
  clock, and data in+out lines.
 -Moved version info silkscreen over to left edge of board, thanked Tursi.

-Additional layout modifications:
  -Flipped C1 horizontally to make room for vias to route GPIO lines on back
   of board to get around C1 and JTAG traces
  -Rerouted nearby JTAG traces to make space for vias near
   GPIO25 and GPIO28
  -Move X1 down to make more space for GPIO traces to pass through near
   cartridge mount hole under USB 2/J3
  -Rerouted one of the XTAL/clock traces under U1/EZHost to free up space for
   vias back to the front of the board under the J2/USB 2 connector
   * Risky, moves clock very close to R1 trace, and JTAG trace a little
     closer to sensitive USB D+/D- vias.
  -Added U5, and U6, pads for 93C46/93C66/93C86 Serial EEPROM save-game
   chips. Unlike Rev. 4, connect pins 6 and 7 to VCC to ensure 16-bit
   organization is selected and write-protection is disabled if using the
   variants of these chips that support such features. on other variants,
   these pins are not connected, so there will be no change in behavior.
  -Added U7, pads for a tiny XSON8 dual AND gate IC which will assist the
   GPIO lines in selecting between the two Serial EEPROM save-game chips.

-Don't put traces too close to USB traces: See notes in
 pcb3/pcb/usbhub-layout.pdf for details.  These traces prefer privacy.

-See butcher/butcher.txt for details on the weird GPIO routing on EZHost and
 how it allows proper booting.

-TODO:
 -Silkscreen:
  -Top:
   -Move version info to left side of board, update to Rev. 5
   -Update copyright year to 2020, indicate public domain
   -Add a thank you to Tursi
  -Bottom
   -Difficult, in that it isn't done in FreePCB, since it does not support
    importing/drawing real graphics. The previous manufacturing releases
    appear to have used an autocad file converted directly to gerber format.
   -Want to add a few things to the existing one that prevent direct re-use:
    -Add a "CE (collectors edition)" to the logo somewhere.
    -Add the JTAG pin labels from Rev. 4 (were very helpful)
    -Potentially label Jaguar connector pin numbers like on front of Rev. 4.
    -Add public-domain 2020 copyright line
 -Enlarge Mini USB mounting pads to make them more secure
 -Triple-check Serial EEPROM pin->Jaguar pin mapping
 -Triple-check EZHost GPIO routing.
 
-Prototype on Rev. 4 PCB:
 -Green  = GPIO25, Cypress
 -Yellow = GPIO28, Cypress
 -White  = SF_CS, Jaguar
 -Blue   = CS, 93C46
